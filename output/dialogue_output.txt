JOHN: I think the new climate proposals are pretty comprehensive, actually. SARAH: Comprehensive? John, the proposed carbon tax rates are far too low based on what the science is telling us. We need bold action, immediate and substantial changes! MIKE: But Sarah, we can't ignore the economic impact of a sudden, massive tax increase. Think about small businesses, working families… SARAH: Mike, we're talking about the future of the planet! Short-term economic concerns shouldn't outweigh the long-term consequences for generations to come. Gradual implementation is better than nothing, I'll grant you that, but it's still far too slow. JOHN: I understand your concerns, Sarah, but we need to be realistic. Politically, pushing for overly aggressive changes right now risks achieving nothing at all. A phased-in carbon tax over five years, coupled with support programs for affected businesses, might be a more viable middle ground. MIKE: I agree with John. Incremental progress is better than no progress. A gradual increase allows businesses to adapt and minimizes the immediate economic shock. SARAH: But at this rate, we'll be decades behind where we need to be. We're talking about irreversible damage. We need to act now, decisively. JOHN: But inaction isn't the answer either. We need to find a balance, something that's both effective and politically achievable. MIKE: Exactly. We have to consider the real-world consequences of our actions. We can't just ignore the potential harm to everyday people. SARAH: I’m not ignoring them. I’m saying we need to prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term economic anxieties. This is a matter of survival. JOHN: But if we don't consider the economic realities, we risk losing crucial political support. And without that support, nothing gets done. MIKE: John's right. We need to find a path that allows us to make progress without crippling the economy. A gradual approach, coupled with assistance for those affected, is the best way forward. SARAH: I still believe we're compromising too much, but I suppose it's better than doing nothing at all.
